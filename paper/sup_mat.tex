%  SUPPORTING INFORMATION TEMPLATE
%
%% ------------------------------------------------------------------------ %%
%
%
%Please use this template when formatting and submitting your Supporting Information.

%This template serves as both a “table of contents” for the supporting information for your article and as a summary of files.
%
%
%OVERVIEW
%
%Please note that all supporting information will be peer reviewed with your manuscript. It will not be copyedited if the paper is accepted.
%In general, the purpose of the supporting information is to enable authors to provide and archive auxiliary information such as data tables, method information, figures, video, or computer software, in digital formats so that other scientists can use it.
%The key criteria are that the data:
% 1. supplement the main scientific conclusions of the paper but are not essential to the conclusions (with the exception of
%    including %data so the experiment can be reproducible);
% 2. are likely to be usable or used by other scientists working in the field;
% 3. are described with sufficient precision that other scientists can understand them, and
% 4. are not exe files.
%
%USING THIS TEMPLATE
%
%***All references should be included in the reference list of the main paper so that they can be indexed, linked, and counted as citations.  The reference section does not count toward length limits.
%
%All Supporting text and figures should be included in this document. Insert supporting information content into each appropriate section of the template. To add additional captions, simply copy and paste each sample as needed.

%Tables may be included, but can also be uploaded separately, especially if they are larger than 1 page, or if necessary for retaining table formatting. Data sets, large tables, movie files, and audio files should be uploaded separately. Include their captions in this document and list the file name with the caption. You will be prompted to upload these files on the Upload Files tab during the submission process, using file type “Supporting Information (SI)”

%IMPORTANT NOTE ON FIGURES AND TABLES
% Placeholders for figures and tables appear after the \end{article} command, after references.
% DO NOT USE \psfrag or \subfigure commands.

%%EXAMPLE CAPTIONS

For completeness, we provide a formal outline of the calculation of the shape derivative of the function $\JLS(\Omega)$ in (\ref{eq.sopb}). 
We essentially reproduce the argument from \cite{allaire2004}, based on C\'ea's method \cite{cea1986}. 

Let us first recall a classical result, which is often referred to as the Reynolds transport theorem, see e.g. \cite{henrot2018}.

\begin{proposition}\label{prop.Reynolds}
Let $f : \R^3 \to \R$ be a smooth function, and let $F(\Omega)$ be defined by:
$$ F(\Omega) := \int_{\Omega^c} f \:\d \x.$$
The shape derivative of the functional $F(\Omega)$ then reads:
$$F^\prime(\Omega)(\btheta) = -\int_\Gamma f (\btheta \cdot \n) \:\d s,$$
where $\n$ is the unit normal vector to $\Gamma$, pointing outward $\Omega$.
\end{proposition}

We now turn the proof of the formula (\ref{eq.sopb}), properly speaking. Let $V$ be the space of vector-valued functions $\u : \R^3 \to \R$ vanishing on the region $\Gammab$, and let $\calL(\Omega,\cdot,\cdot) : V \times V \to \R$ be defined by:
$$ \displaystyle\calL(\Omega,\u,\p) = \displaystyle\int_{\Gammau} \lvert \u - \uobs \lvert^2 \:\d s  + \displaystyle\int_{\Omega ^c}Ae(\u) : e(\p) \:\d \x - \Delta P \displaystyle\int_\Gamma \p \cdot \n \:\d s.$$
Intuitively, $\calL(\Omega,\u,\p)$ is the Lagrangian associated to the minimization problem (\ref{eq.sopb}), in the equivalent formulation where the elasticity problem (\ref{eq.elas}) for the displacement $\u_\Omega$ of the underground is seen as a constraint and $\p$ is the associated Lagrange multiplier, that is: 
\begin{equation}\label{eq.eqminpb}
\min\limits_{\Omega, \u} \int_{\Gamma_u} \lvert \u - \uobs\lvert^2 \:\d s \text{ s.t. }
\left\{
\begin{array}{cl}
-\dv(Ae(\u)) = \bz & \text{in } \Omega^c,\\
\u = \bz & \text{on } \Gammab, \\
Ae(\u)(-\n) = \Delta P \n& \text{on } \Gamma, \\
Ae(\u)\n = \bz& \text{on } \partial D\setminus \overline{\Gammab}, \\
\end{array}
\right.
\end{equation}
By construction, it holds: 
\begin{equation}\label{eq.JLScalL}
 \forall \p \in V, \quad \JLS(\Omega) = \calL(\Omega,\u_\Omega, \p ) .
 \end{equation}

Introducing a smooth function $\chi : \R^3 \to \R$, which equals $1$ on $\Omega$ and $0$ on $\partial D$, and applying the Green's formula, we may rewrite the last integral as an integral over the domain $\Omega^c$:
$$  \displaystyle\calL(\Omega,\u,\p) = \displaystyle\int_{\Gammau} \lvert \u - \uobs \lvert^2 \:\d s  + \displaystyle\int_{\Omega^c} Ae(\u) : e(\p) \:\d \x + \Delta P \int_{\Omega^c} \dv(\chi \p) \:\d \x   .$$

For a given shape $\Omega$, $\u$ attains the minimum in (\ref{eq.eqminpb}) if there exists $\p \in V$ such that $(\u,\p) \in V \times V$ is a saddle point of the function $\calL(\Omega,\cdot,\cdot)$. 
We then search for these saddle points. To achieve this, we equate the partial derivatives of $\calL(\Omega,\cdot,\cdot)$ to $0$. This yields: 
\begin{equation}\label{eq.derp}
\forall \widehat{\p} \in V, \quad \int_{\Omega^c} Ae(\u):e(\widehat{\p}) \:\d \x - \Delta P \int_{\Gamma}  \widehat{\p} \cdot \n  \:\d s = 0 , 
\end{equation}
and
\begin{equation}\label{eq.deru}
\forall \widehat{\u} \in V, \quad  2 \int_{\Gammau} (\u - \uobs)\cdot \widehat{\u} \:\d s + \int_{\Omega^c} Ae(\widehat{\u}):e(\p) \:\d \x =0. 
\end{equation}
From the first relation (\ref{eq.derp}), it immediately follows that $\u$ is the unique solution $\u_\Omega$ to the state equation (\ref{eq.elas}). 
From the second relation (\ref{eq.deru}), we see that $\p$ is the solution $\p_\Omega$ to the adjoint system (\ref{eq.adj}). 

Let us now return to the equation (\ref{eq.JLScalL}). Taking derivatives with respect to the shape $\Omega$ in both sides, the chain rule yields:
\begin{equation}\label{eq.derLOmuprime}
\forall \p \in V, \quad \JLS^\prime(\Omega)(\btheta) =  \frac{\partial \calL}{\partial \Omega}(\Omega,\u_\Omega,\p) (\theta) + \frac{\partial \calL}{\partial \u} (\Omega,\u_\Omega,\p) (\u_\Omega^\prime(\btheta)).
\end{equation}
The first partial derivative in the above right-hand side is the derivative of the mapping $\Omega \mapsto \calL(\Omega,\u,\p)$ (for fixed $\u$, $\p \in V$), which is eventually evaluated at $\u = \u_\Omega$ and $\p$. This quantity is easily computed thanks to Proposition \ref{prop.Reynolds}. 
The function $\u_\Omega^\prime(\btheta)$ appearing in the second term is the so-called ``Eulerian derivative'' of the mapping $\Omega \mapsto \u_\Omega$. Although the latter can be characterized by a boundary value problem, we wish to eliminate this difficult contribution. To achieve this, we now select $\p = \p_\Omega$ in (\ref{eq.derLOmuprime}), so that the second integral in the above right-hand side vanishes, see (\ref{eq.deru}). We are thus left with:
$$ \JLS^\prime(\Omega)(\btheta) =  \frac{\partial \calL}{\partial \Omega}(\Omega,\u_\Omega,\p_\Omega) (\btheta).$$
A simple calculation based on Proposition \ref{prop.Reynolds} now yields: 
$$ \JLS^\prime(\Omega)(\btheta) = - \int_\Gamma Ae(\u_\Omega):e(\p_\Omega) (\btheta\cdot \n) \:\d s - \Delta P\int_\Gamma \dv( \p_\Omega ) (\btheta\cdot \n)\:\d s,  $$
as desired.
