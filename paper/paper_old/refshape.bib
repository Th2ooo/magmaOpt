  abstract = {Many examples of exposed giant dike swarms can be found where lateral magma flow exceeded hundreds of kilometers. We show that massive magma flow into dikes can be established with only modest overpressure in a magma body, if a large enough pathway opens at its boundary, and gradual build-up of high tensile stress has occurred along the dike pathway prior to onset of diking. This explains rapid initial magma flow rates, modeled up to about 7400 m               3               /s into a dike approximately 15 km long, propagating under the town of Grindavík, Southwest Iceland, in November 2023. Such high flow rates provide insight into the formation of major dikes and imply a serious hazard potential for high flow-rate intrusions that propagate to the surface and transition into eruptions.},

  abstract = {Approximate solutions are obtained for the stress and displacement fields due to a pressurized spherical cavity in an elastic half‐space. The solutions take the form of series expansions in powers of ε =               a               /               d               , where               a               is the cavity radius and               d               is the depth. The leading‐order term in the expression for the surface uplift, which arises at               O               (ε               3               ), recovers the well‐known result of Mogi for the response to a point dilatation. The first higher‐order correction accounts for a cavity of finite size and thus offers the possibility of fitting leveling data for not only the depth but also the radius and pressure increment. However, this correction is of               O               (ε               6               ) and, consequently, is weak. The result provides a formal explanation for the success of the point dilatation model in representing uplift data even when it is known independently that ε is not small. The higher‐order correction causes the surface uplift to fall off more rapidly in the radial direction, implying that a fit of the point source solution tends to underestimate the depth               d               . In contrast to the surface displacement, the stress field near the cavity is affected profoundly by the proximity of the free surface. Three higher‐order corrections to the stress field are obtained, which result in a uniformly valid approximation to               O               (ε               5               ). The hoop stress at the cavity exhibits a tensile maximum at the circle of tangency with a cone with its apex at the free surface. This result appears to be consistent with the locus of fractures radiating outward from the magma body inferred by seismic methods in Long Valley, California.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            New satellite missions (e.g., the European Space Agency's Sentinel‐1 constellation), advances in data downlinking, and rapid product generation now provide us with the ability to access space‐geodetic data within hours of their acquisition. To truly take advantage of this opportunity, we need to be able to interpret geodetic data in a prompt and robust manner. Here we present a Bayesian approach for the inversion of multiple geodetic data sets that allows a rapid characterization of posterior probability density functions (PDFs) of source model parameters. The inversion algorithm efficiently samples posterior PDFs through a Markov chain Monte Carlo method, incorporating the Metropolis‐Hastings algorithm, with automatic step size selection. We apply our approach to synthetic geodetic data simulating deformation of magmatic origin and demonstrate its ability to retrieve known source parameters. We also apply the inversion algorithm to interferometric synthetic aperture radar data measuring co‐seismic displacements for a thrust‐faulting earthquake (2015               M                                w                              6.4 Pishan earthquake, China) and retrieve optimal source parameters and associated uncertainties. Given its robustness and rapidity in estimating deformation source parameters and uncertainties, our Bayesian framework is capable of taking advantage of real‐time geodetic measurements. Thus, our approach can be applied to geodetic data to study magmatic, tectonic, and other geophysical processes, especially in rapid‐response operational settings (e.g., volcano observatories). Our algorithm is fully implemented in a MATLAB®‐based software package (Geodetic Bayesian Inversion Software) that we make freely available to the scientific community.                        ,              Key Points                                                                We present a Bayesian approach for the inversion of geodetic data and demonstrate successful applications to synthetic and real data                                                     Our approach allows rapid estimates of source parameters and uncertainties and is well suited for rapid‐response and operational settings                                                     We have implemented our approach in a MATLAB®‐based software package (GBIS) that is made freely available to the scientific community},

VSM allows the user to choose one or more deformation sources of various shapes as a forward model among sphere, spheroid, ellipsoid, rectangular dislocation, and sill. It supports multiple datasets from most satellite and terrestrial geodetic techniques: Interferometric SAR, GNSS, leveling, Electronic Distance Measurements, tiltmeters, and strainmeters. Two sampling algorithms are available: one is a global optimization algorithm based on the Voronoi cells and yields the best-fitting solution and the second follows a probabilistic approach to parameters estimation based on the Bayes theorem and the Markov chain Monte Carlo method. VSM can be executed as Python script, in Jupyter Notebook environments, or by its Graphical User Interface. Its broad applications range from high-level research to teaching, from single studies to near real-time hazard estimates. Potential users range from early-career scientists to experts.

The method was originally developed for mechanical design problems but has within the last six years been applied to a range of photonics applications. Topology optimization may be based on finite element and finite difference type modeling methods in both frequency and time domain. The basic idea is that the material density of each element or grid point is a design variable, hence the geometry is parameterized in a pixel-like fashion. The optimization problem is efficiently solved using mathematical programming-based optimization methods and analytical gradient calculations. The paper reviews the basic procedures behind topology optimization, a large number of applications ranging from photonic crystal design to surface plasmonic devices, and lists some of the future challenges in non-linear applications.},

The coupling is weak because the equations involved are solved consecutively, namely the steady state Navier–Stokes equations for the fluid domain, first, the convection diffusion equation for the whole domain, second, and the linear thermo-elasticity system in the solid domain, third. Shape sensitivities are derived in a fully Lagrangian setting which allows us to obtain shape derivatives of general objective functions. An emphasis is given on the derivation of the adjoint interface condition dual to the one of equality of the normal stresses at the fluid solid interface. The arguments allowing to obtain this surprising condition are specifically detailed on a simplified scalar problem. Numerical test cases are presented using the level set mesh evolution framework of Allaire et al. (Appl Mech Eng 282:22–53, 2014). It is demonstrated how the implementation enables to treat a variety of shape optimization problems.},

  abstract = {This article deals with the optimization of the shape of the regions assigned to different types of boundary conditions in the definition of a ‘physical’ partial differential equation. At first, we analyze a model situation involving the solution \$\$u\_\textbackslash varOmega \$\$to a Laplace equation in a domain \$\$\textbackslash varOmega \$\$; the boundary \$\$\textbackslash partial \textbackslash varOmega \$\$is divided into three parts \$\$\textbackslash varGamma \_D\$\$, \$\$\textbackslash varGamma \$\$and \$\$\textbackslash varGamma \_N\$\$, supporting respectively homogeneous Dirichlet, homogeneous Neumann and inhomogeneous Neumann boundary conditions. The shape derivative \$\$J\textasciicircum\textbackslash prime (\textbackslash varOmega )(\textbackslash theta )\$\$of a general objective function \$\$J(\textbackslash varOmega )\$\$of the domain is calculated in the framework of Hadamard’s method when the considered deformations \$\$\textbackslash theta \$\$are allowed to modify the geometry of \$\$\textbackslash varGamma \_D\$\$, \$\$\textbackslash varGamma \$\$and \$\$\textbackslash varGamma \_N\$\$(i.e. \$\$\textbackslash theta \$\$does not vanish on the boundary of these regions). The structure of this shape derivative turns out to depend very much on the regularity of \$\$u\_\textbackslash varOmega \$\$near the boundaries of the regions \$\$\textbackslash varGamma \_D\$\$, \$\$\textbackslash varGamma \$\$and \$\$\textbackslash varGamma \_N\$\$. For this reason, in particular, \$\$J\textasciicircum\textbackslash prime (\textbackslash varOmega )\$\$is difficult to calculate and to evaluate numerically when the transition \$\$\textbackslash overline\{\textbackslash varGamma \_D\} \textbackslash cap \{\textbackslash overline\{\textbackslash varGamma \}\}\$\$between homogeneous Dirichlet and homogeneous Neumann boundary conditions is subject to optimization. To overcome this difficulty, an approximation method is proposed, in which the considered ‘exact’ Laplace equation with mixed boundary conditions is replaced with a ‘smoothed’ version, featuring Robin boundary conditions on the whole boundary \$\$\textbackslash partial \textbackslash varOmega \$\$with coefficients depending on a small parameter \$\$\textbackslash varepsilon \$\$. We prove the consistency of this approach in our model context: the approximate objective function \$\$J\_\textbackslash varepsilon (\textbackslash varOmega )\$\$and its shape derivative converge to their exact counterparts as \$\$\textbackslash varepsilon \$\$vanishes. Although it is rigorously justified only in a model problem, this approximation methodology may be adapted to many more complex situations, for example in three space dimensions, or in the context of the linearized elasticity system. Various numerical examples are eventually presented in order to appraise the efficiency of the proposed approximation process.},

  abstract = {An efficient framework is described for the shape and topology optimization of realistic three-dimensional, weakly-coupled fluid-thermal-mechanical systems. At the theoretical level, the proposed methodology relies on the boundary variation of Hadamard for describing the sensitivity of functions with respect to the domain. From the numerical point of view, three key ingredients are used: (i) a level set based mesh evolution method allowing to describe large deformations of the shape while maintaining an adapted, high-quality mesh of the latter at every stage of the optimization process; (ii) an efficient constrained optimization algorithm which is very well adapted to the infinite-dimensional shape optimization context; (iii) efficient preconditioning techniques for the solution of large finite element systems in a reasonable computational time. The performance of our strategy is illustrated with two examples of coupled physics: respectively fluid–structure interaction and convective heat transfer. Before that, we perform three other test cases, involving a single physics (structural, thermal and aerodynamic design), for comparison purposes and for assessing our various tools: in particular, they prove the ability of the mesh evolution technique to capture very thin bodies or shells in 3D.},

  abstract = {Exact analytic expressions are given for the deformation field resulting from inflation of a finite prolate spheroidal cavity in an infinite elastic medium. The field is equivalent to that generated by a parabolic distribution of double forces and centers of dilatation along the spheroid generator. Approximate, but quite accurate, solutions for a dipping spheroid in an elastic half-space are found using the half-space double force and center of dilatation solutions. We compare results of the surface deformation field with those generated by the point source ellipsoidal model of Davis (1986). In the far field both models give identical results. In the near field the finite model must be used to calculate displacements and stresses within the medium. We also test the limits of applicability of the finite model as it approaches the surface by comparing the surface displacement field from a vertical spheroid with that calculated from the finite element method. We find the model gives a satisfactory approximation to the finite element results when the minimum radius of curvature of the upper surface is less than or equal to its depth beneath the free surface. Comparison of surface displacements generated by the point and finite element models gives good agreement, provided this criterion is satisfied. We have used the finite model to invert deformation data from Kilauea volcano, Hawaii. The results, which compare favorably with those obtained from the point ellipsoid model, can be used to estimate the distribution of stresses within the volcano in the near field of the source.},

  abstract = {Numerical techniques, as such as finite element method, allow for the inclusion of features, such as topography and/or mechanical heterogeneities, for the interpretation of volcanic deformation. However, models based on these numerical techniques usually are not suitable to be included in non-linear estimations of source parameters based on explorative optimization schemes because they require a calculation of the numerical approach for every evaluation of the misfit function. We present a procedure for finite element (FE) models that can be combined with explorative inversion schemes. The methodology is based on including a body force term representing an infinitesimal source in the model formulation that is responsible for pressure (volume) changes in the medium. This provides significant savings in both the time required for mesh generation and actual computational time of the numerical approach. Furthermore, we develop an inversion algorithm to estimate those parameters that characterize the changes in location and pressure (volume) of deformation sources. Both provide FE inversions in a single step, avoiding remeshing and assembly of the linear system of algebraic equations that define the numerical approach and/or the automatic mesh generation. After providing the theoretical basis for the model, the numerical approach and the algorithm for the inversions, we test the methodology using a synthetic example in a stratovolcano. Our results suggest that the FE inversion methodology can be considered suitable for efficiently save time in quantitative interpretations of volcano deformation.},

  abstract = {The Copahue volcano is one of the most active volcanoes in Argentina with eruptions having been reported as recently as 1992, 1995 and 2000. A deformation analysis using the Differential Synthetic Aperture Radar technique (DInSAR) was performed on Copahue–Caviahue Volcanic Complex (CCVC) from Envisat radar images between 2002 and 2007. A deformation rate of approximately 2cm/yr was calculated, located mostly on the north-eastern flank of Copahue volcano, and assumed to be constant during the period of the interferograms. The geometry of the source responsible for the deformation was evaluated from an inversion of the mean velocity deformation measurements using two different models based on pressure sources embedded in an elastic homogeneous half-space. A genetic algorithm was applied as an optimization tool to find the best fit source. Results from inverse modelling indicate that a source located beneath the volcano edifice at a mean depth of 4km is producing a volume change of approximately 0.0015km/yr. This source was analysed considering the available studies of the area, and a conceptual model of the volcanic–hydrothermal system was designed. The source of deformation is related to a depressurisation of the system that results from the release of magmatic fluids across the boundary between the brittle and plastic domains. These leakages are considered to be responsible for the weak phreatic eruptions recently registered at the Copahue volcano.},

  abstract = {Magma movements are almost universally associated with volcanic deformation. The Mogi (1958) and McTigue (1987) models link observed surface displacements to behaviour within inaccessible magmatic plumbing systems. Mogi and McTigue models are well-used due to their computational simplicity and ease of application, but both models are limited by their assumptions about the deformation source and its embedding domain. Domain assumptions, including elasticity, homogeneity, and flat topography, have been previously described and corrected for. Whilst recognising the limits of these models, their frequent use in the literature requires an objective assessment of their utility against more sophisticated Finite Element (FE) models, their operational limits (radius-to-depth ratio, ε) and their relative merits in the light of limited field data. Here, we relax the source assumption of a small ε. We simulate volcanic deformation using Mogi, McTigue and FE models - the latter unrestricted by ε - to validate the maximum ε for which the analytical models can be applied, and to compare analytical and FE interpretations of deformation data from Kīlauea Volcano, Hawai'i. We find that analytical and FE models correspond for deformation sources with a range of ε that is wider than previously suggested limits. The differences between simulated surface displacements (forward modelling) and estimated deformation source parameters (inverse modelling) are less than 5\% when ε~{$<~$}0.37 (Mogi) or ε~{$<~$}0.59 (McTigue). Misfits between analytical and FE models depend on whether radial or vertical displacements are considered simultaneously or independently, and on the values of source radius and depth - not only their ratio, as was assumed previously. There is little or no difference between best-fitting source parameters inferred using Mogi, McTigue and FE models at Kīlauea Volcano, despite the high ε of the system geometry, but sometimes poor correspondences between model results and GNSS observations. Our results demonstrate that Mogi and McTigue models can be applied to volcanoes with a wider range of magma reservoir radii and depths than was hitherto supposed, but previously-established corrections for domain simplifications are necessary to accurately interpret volcanic deformation.},
