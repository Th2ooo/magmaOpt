# Tutorial for magmaOpt


## Basic usage

To interact with the code as a standard user, the only file you need to modify is **sources/path.py**. There, you will set all the parameters for your case study. Once it is done, you just need to run **sources/main.py**. Note that this code is in devloppment stage. You are invited to modify the code and test the different parameters of the diverse functions to fit to your specific needs.


### **path.py** parameters

You only need to configure this file if you want to run your own test cases. Here is a short description of what  you can modify, section by section. In the provided state, **path.py** is parametrized to run a test case similar to the one presented section 3.1 of the article.
